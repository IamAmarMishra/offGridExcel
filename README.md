# DIGIT EXTRACTION FROM TABLES
## Model to extract digits from table and feed to Excel automatically.

*************************************
### *Description*: 

*To develop a deep learning model that can automate the process of marks storage by detecting the marks from score table and storing those marks into storage units according to the roll number of the student, thus saving the precious time of teaching and non-teaching staff.*

*****************************************

### *Benefits*:
```
1. No manual work required for feeding the marks into storage system.
2. Automated procedure. 
3. Huge amount time can be saved. 
4. For feeding the marks from large number of answer sheets will require very less amount of time.
```
*****************************************
### *Technology stack*:

Python,OpenCV,Numpy,Openpyxl,Tensorflow
*****************************************

### *Key functionality*: 
```
1. Preprocess the image using OpenCV.
2. Roll no. Detection using Image Processing.
3. Marks Table Detection using Image Processing.
4. Extracting cells from detected table with help of contours.
5. Digit Recognition from the extracted cells.
6. Feeding digits to excel sheet.
```
**************************************

### *Running the code*:

```
1. Download the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Activate the virtual enviornment.
4. Install the required dependencies using pip.
5. Open Terminal and navigate to repository folder.
6. Run Driver.py using (python Driver.py).
7. Digits(Marks) will be fed to excel sheet automatically.
